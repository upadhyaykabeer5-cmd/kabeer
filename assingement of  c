Arrays: Meaning, Example, and Declaration
An array is a collection of variables of the same data type stored at contiguous memory locations and accessed using a common name with an index. Arrays let you store and efficiently access multiple values using a single variable name.​

Example & Declaration in C:

c
int numbers[5];     // declares array of 5 integers
numbers[0] = 10;    // first element assigned value 10
In the code above, int numbers[5]; creates an integer array with 5 elements, and numbers = 10; sets the first value to 10.​

Functions: Meaning, Types, and Code
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called whenever needed. Functions help organize code into reusable and manageable parts.​

Types of functions:

Built-in (library) functions

User-defined functions

Built-in Function Example (C):

c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello World"); // printf is a built-in function
    return 0;
}
User-defined Function Example (C):

c
#include <stdio.h>
void greet() {                // user-defined function
    printf("Welcome!");
}
int main() {
    greet();                  // calling user-defined function
    return 0;
}
Built-in functions like printf() come from libraries, while user-defined functions like greet() are written by the programmer.​

Pointers: Meaning and Initialization Code
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers provide powerful ways to handle memory and data directly.​

Pointer Initialization Example (C):

c
int x = 25;
int *ptr = &x;   // ptr is a pointer to int, initialized with address of x
Here, ptr points to the location in memory where x is stored.​

Types of Arrays with Code: 1D and 2D
Arrays are categorized based on their dimension:

1D Array: Linear array.

2D Array: Matrix-like, array of arrays.​

1D Array Example:

c
int marks[5] = {90, 80, 70, 60, 50};
2D Array Example:

c
int matrix[2][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
1D arrays store data sequentially, while 2D arrays organize data in rows and columns.​

Types of Operators in Code
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Main types include:​

Operator Type	Example Code	Explanation
Arithmetic	int a = 5 + 3;	Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulus (%)​
Assignment	a = 10;	Assigns value (=), add and assign (+=), subtract and assign (-=)​
Unary	a++;	Increment (++), Decrement (--), Plus (+), Minus (-), Logical NOT (!)​
Relational	if(a > b)	Greater than (>), Less than (<), Equal to (==), Not Equal (!=)​
Logical	if(a > 0 && b < 5)	AND (&&), OR (
Bitwise	a = a & b;	AND (&), OR (
